- 👋 Hi, I’m @brwaters
- 👀 I’m interested in deploying microservices with Docker, using nginx as a reverse proxy, developing middleware with Go and developing a game with Unity!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Software Engineering at University of Victoria
- 💞️ I’m looking for co-op work term experience

You can find short clips of my game demos (and other work) ![here!]([https://vimeo.com/874589220](https://vimeo.com/user207393122))
